            <p>
              I devote myself to being a software developer because it
              lets me use my creative and problem-solving skills as I believe
              design thinking can be adapted into building app/web/projects!
            </p>
            <p>Software development wasn't my initial career
              path, but I'm glad I discovered it. I sought more flexibility,
              possibility, and improvement for projects and works during my
              marketing and graphic design career. In the end, all the
              experience points me to the same goal: software development.</p>
            <p>I'm a self-motivated learner with strong
              organization, time management and communication skills.</p>
